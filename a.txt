Geological layer generator for [Minetest] "rocks"
=============

Aim of this mod is to replace all generic stone (default:stone) and 
generate underground layers of different rocks.

Features
--------

* layers of different rocks: sort of working
* ore veins: being added
* extensibility, api: changed million times

** Work in progress! **

* git clone git://repo.or.cz/rocks.git ([show](http://repo.or.cz/rocks.git/))
* (old) Git clone: [https](https://gitorious.org/mt/rocks.git)

Documentation
-------------

How the underground is generated: *todo*.

Mod has been rewritten, so no doc yet.

The sedimentary layer
-------------

Is implemented by modifiing MGv7 biomes to use rocks's sedimentary rocks. 
This means that you need mapgen v7 enabled. I also suggest enabling caves 
and dungeons, as they are cool. 

This mod nor minetest_game/default however do not define meaningful biomes. 
So if you do not want unlimited grassland I suggest installing the 
[Paramat's biomesdev mod](https://github.com/paramat/biomesdev) and adding 
"rocks?" to depends.txt file inside the biomesdev folder. This is needed, 
becouse "rock" overrides the standard biome registration callback to patch 
in it's own sedimentary rocks.

Soil is normlly 50-70 cm deep in real life, so I made soil (dirt) only 1 
block thick. Under this thin layer of dirt an sedimentary layer is located. 
In RL, there is clay and other stuff.

Currently 2 sedimentary formations exists:

### Coal

Large panes of coal spawn directly under grass. But be warned, they are 
really large and not-so-common. Best strategy is to follow rivers (MGv7 
ridges) or randomly walk around and dig 2 block hole to see if coal is 
there.

### Clay

Spawn simillary to coal, but not as large.
